# dls

Distributed Locking Service (dls) is a service which aims to provide a service which will be used for synchronisation purposes in a distributed (cloud) environment.

The main purpose of the project is to provide high availability. Another important feature of such a system would be high scalability. This is not in the scope of this project.

## Architecture

**dls** achieves its goals based on an architecture described [here](./doc/architecture.md).
